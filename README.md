# MMM: Quantum-Chemical Molecular Representation Learning for Combinatorial Drug Recommendation
This repository contains the official implementation of **"MMM: Quantum-Chemical Molecular Representation Learning for Combinatorial Drug Recommendation"**.

## Experimental Setup
We provide the network architecture of the proposed MMM model, along with the pipeline code to enable users to train and test the network on the EHR dataset and drug molecular ELF image. The DDI calculations and drug information used in this work are based on the implementation from [SafeDrug](https://github.com/ycq091044/SafeDrug)'s repository. All experiments were conducted in an environment with Python 3.9.23, PyTorch 2.3.0+cu118, and CUDA 11.8.

### Package Install
To further train the model, you need to install RDKit-related tools and several packages. To avoid version conflicts among these packages, please follow the installation steps in the exact order below.
1) First, create and activate a new conda environment.
```
conda create -c conda-forge -n new_env python=3.9
```
```
conda activate new_env
```
2) Install RDKit
```
conda install -c conda-forge rdkit
```
3) If RDKit does not work after the above installation, try:
```
pip install rdkit-pypi
```
4) Install numpy, pandas, and scipy with specific versions to avoid conflicts:
```
pip install numpy==1.22.4
```
```
pip install pandas==1.3.0
```
```
pip install numpy==1.13.1
```
5) Install PyTorch (torch) and torchvision using pip:
```
pip install torch torchvision
```

### Dataset and Hyperparameter Configuration
Data paths and hyperparameters (such as learning rate, target_ddi, etc.) are configured in the MMM_TEST.py (or MMM_RS.py) file. Dataset paths should be set in the code to correctly correspond to the input and output folders. Running the preprocessing script processing.py automatically generates related files within the output folder. The paths in the code must then be updated accordingly to reflect the locations of these generated files.

- Dataset Configuration 
In MMM_TEST.py (or MMM_RS.py), the paths for the following variables must be updated to correspond to the .pkl files generated within the output folder:
```
data_path = "[records_final.pkl]"
voc_path = "[voc_final.pkl]"
ddi_adj_path = "[ddi_A_final.pkl]"
ddi_mask_path = "[ddi_mask_H.pkl]"
molecule_path = "[cidtoSMILES.pkl]"
ddi_rate = ddi_rate_score("[ddi_A_final.pkl]")
```
These should be set to point to the corresponding .pkl files generated by preprocessing, typically located in the data/output folder.

The overall dataset folder structure is organized as follows:

- Hyperparameter Configuration
Hyperparameters can be configured in MMM_TEST.py (or MMM_RS.py). These hyperparameters are set using the argparse module, allowing default values to be specified and overridden via command-line arguments:
```
hyperparameters = {
    "Test": [True or False],               
    "model_name": ["model_identifier"],   
    "resume_path": ["path/to/checkpoint"], 
    "lr": [learning_rate],              
    "target_ddi": [target_ddi],  
    "kp": [coefficient_of_P_signal],   
    "dim": [dimension_size],        
    "cuda": [cuda_device_index]
}
```
- Setting the Experimental Results Path
Before running the experiment, it is necessary to configure the paths for saving experimental results and model checkpoints. In the training script, the model checkpoints and training history are saved under the directory structure:
```
saved/{model_name}/
```
where {model_name} is specified via the command-line argument --model_name.

Model checkpoints are saved during training with filenames formatted as:
```
Epoch_{epoch_number}_TARGET_{target_ddi}_JA-ATC3_{jaccard_atc3}_JA-CID_{jaccard_cid}_DDI_{ddi_rate}.model
saved/{model_name}/history_{model_name}.pkl
```
- Run the Code
<Train>
```
python MMM_TEST.py
```
<Test>
```
python MMM_TEST.py --Test --resume_path [best_epoch_path]
```
